# FNF-Voicebanks
All of the custom Friday Night Funkin' Voicebanks I use in my videos. If you use these, you have to credit me in the description of your videos.

BIG CHANGES!
-I'm going through the Funkipedia's Chromatic Storage and converting them into useable UTAU Voicebanks. These are free to use, so long as you make sure to credit myself. Any extra credits are gonna be listed here as necessary.
Any custom Voicebank that I recorded or otherwise made BY MYSELF is going to have the "[BP3241]" Prefix so to distinguish real mods from mine.
The old voicebank storage will remain for Archival purposes, just don't use that one if you're looking for better quality stuff.
