Heya! Just some quick tips regarding my Voicebanks! You're able to use these however you'd like, Just make sure to credit both Bumper3241 and the Mod Creators!

Vs. Steve - Just Minecraft's hurt sound, used in the Vs. Steve mod
Vs. Alex - You can't use this in UTAU, you have to add it to Minecraft Note Block Studio's custom sounds, save that as MP3, then import that into Audacity, FL Studio, or whatever audio editing software you have - used in the Vs. Steve Mod
Vs. Maggie - Used in the Subwoofer Showdown mod
Vs. Sans - Sampled from the Dusttale version of Sans
Vs. Myra - Used in the Tales from the Raveyard mod

If I make more, I'll add them to this repository!
